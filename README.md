# Kiro MCP Agents Tutorial

A progressive 20-step tutorial for learning Agents and MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration with Kiro IDE.
Start ultra-simple with basic TypeScript tooling, then gradually build sophisticated agents that can integrate with Kiro's ecosystem.

## Tutorial Overview

This tutorial teaches agent development through hands-on examples, progressing from simple scripts to sophisticated MCP-integrated tools.

### Current Progress

✅ **Step 01** - Hello World: Basic TypeScript project setup  
✅ **Step 02** - Hello Lint: ESLint configuration and tooling  
✅ **Step 03** - Hello Agent: First autonomous linting agent with Kiro Hooks integration  
⏩ **Step 04-20** - Coming soon: Testing agents, refactoring tools, MCP integration, and advanced patterns

## Goals

✅ **Project-level agents**: Each project contains its own specialized agents  
✅ **Kiro integration**: Seamless connection with Kiro IDE through Hooks and MCP  
✅ **Progressive complexity**: Start simple, add sophistication gradually  
✅ **Real-world applicable**: Patterns you can use in production projects  
✅ **Educational**: Clear examples with detailed explanations

## Getting Started

Each step is a self-contained project in its own folder:

```
01-hello-world/     # Basic TypeScript setup
02-hello-lint/      # ESLint configuration  
03-hello-agent/     # First autonomous agent
04-*/               # Future steps...
```

Navigate to any step folder and follow its README for specific instructions.

## Architecture Philosophy

- **Project-scoped agents**: Agents live within projects, not globally
- **Version controlled**: Agents evolve with the codebase they serve
- **Team shareable**: Clone the project, get the agents
- **Kiro integrated**: Seamless IDE integration through Hooks and MCP
- **Incremental learning**: Each step builds on the previous ones
